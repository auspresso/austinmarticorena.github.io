<h1> Overview </h1>
<p>Travel is a leisure activity that has always been on people’s mind. However, each year more and more people are 
starting to make those dream trips a reality due to many technology companies lowering the cost and mystery 
of travel. While many problems have been solved, there is still opportunity to increase the experience of trip planning.
 Truvay wants to remove the impersonal planning from travel and increase social interaction to spur more delightful 
trips, and my responsibility was to help design and develop this vision to bring it into reality. 
</p>

<h1> Problem </h1>
<p>The travel industry is a monolithic industry worth approximately $7.17 trillion according to statistia.com. Because this industry is so large, it has lead to many smaller, innovative companies such as Airbnb, Hopper, TripAdvisor, etc. to enter the market. While these companies have provided exponential value, there is one key issue they have all failed to monetize on, which is social feedback from trusted friends, celebrities and people’s inner circle. Truvay has set out to solve this issue and provide further insight during the travel planning phase of vacation and travel experiences.</p>
    
<h1> Solution </h1>
<p>Truvay is an online application where you can see how many friends have visited a destination, view their reviews on a certain listing and see their itineraries for each place they have visited. This approach is a way to narrow down thousands of very vocal people on the internet to specific people whom you respect and trust and who have similar interests to you. The process below dives into if this idea was viable and problems other people are experience in the travel planning process.</p>
    
<h1> Process </h1>
<p>Being an avid traveler, it is always such a process to figure out exactly what I want to experience when visiting a certain place. There are always those main draws such as the Eiffel Tower in Paris and the Colosseum in Rome. However, past these main draws, lays hours upon hours of trying to find those experience that align perfectly with your interests, not just those of the masses. It is great that TripAdvisor has reviews form 5,000 people from people on this one activity, but how do I know these people’s interests are aligned with mine? </p>
    
<h2> Survey Feedback </h2>
<ul>
<li>From the initial survey sent out, I discovered that even with so many tools at everyone’s disposal, almost 70% of respondents asked their friends for travel recommendations before asking the internet</li>
    <br>
<li>75% of respondents do all of their planning before they even begin their travels</li>
    <br>
<li>The biggest frustrations cited with planning a trip is finding the best non-touristy things to experience followed by advertisement overload on travel websites</li>
    <br>
<li>84% of respondents travel at least once every 3 months, so their responses were valuable</li>
    <br>
<li>73% use their desktop/laptop computer to plan their travels</li>
</ul> 
</p>
    
<h2> Personas </h2>
<p>After looking through the survey results, it was clear that there is a clear opportunity to provide real value to people during the travel planning process. To keep the on track with their goals, frustrations and needs, three personas were developed to guide the design process.</p>
    
<h2> Competitive Analysis </h2>
<p>The main competition for Truvay include TripAdvisor, Pinterest & the Travel Channel.  Diving into each of these websites provided clarity on what value Truvay can provide and which areas of this process are well covered and they should stay away from. You can view the complete competitive analysis here</p>
    
<h2> User Flows</h2>
<p>User Flows were developed to start getting a sense of how users would filter through a lot of data, with minimum effort on their end. You can find a detailed look at the flows here</p>
    
<h2> User Stories </h2>
<p>The core user stories include:
<br>
<br>   
Users should be able to follow friends and influencers
<br>
<br>
Users should be able to see how many of the people they follow have been to a certain destination
<br>
<br>
Users should be able to read their friends reviews on a given destination
<br>
<br>
Users should be able to save places they want to visit
<br>
<br>
Users should be able to create itineraries for their future trips
</p>
    
<h2> Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
<p>Using the basic user stories above, I create the intial wireframes to start to understand how the application should flow. </p>
    
<h2> Creating the Identity </h2>
<p>The travel industry is a noisy space with advertisements from every which way demanding your attention. I built a bright and vibrant color palette to indicate adventure and happiness. However, my aim was to use a lot of whitespace and imagery so when exposure to the core color palette was used, it was noticed and meant something.
The name Truvay is a made up variation of the french noun, trouvaille, which translates to, “a lucky find.” I thought the name is extremely fitting for what Truvay is trying to accomplish.
The logo type is two paddles crossed over in an almost patch-like formation. This is playing off of the boy scout patches. Each one of those patches was earned through many great experiences and when you look at those patches, you know there is a great story behind each one. Truvay is a place for travelers to say those types of experiences and guide their friends and fan base to exciting and rewarding experiences during their travels.</p>
    
<h2> High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
<p>At this point, I had enough validation and resources to start building out the designs of the application. Using Sketch, I built each iteration of the application.</p>
    
<h2> User Testing Feedback</h2>
<p>
Testing throughout the process, a few adjustments needed to be made:
<br>
<br>
Itinerary Page
<br>
<br>
    I first designed the itinerary page to live atop the listing page. It would make it easy to create a new itinerary while looking at listings. However, after discussing with some potential users, the majority said they would use the itinerary page in isolation. The options they would use would be to either add the listing to their bucket list or an existing itinerary. I built a variation of an itinerary on its own isolated page and did an A/B text. The isolated page won by a landslide.
<br>
<br>
Sort & Filter Options
<br>
<br>
    There was a large amount of confusion with the sort & filter icon. After seeing a few users struggle, I moved the sort & filter options below the search bar after a search has been made and removed the icon and used the test instead and this solved that flow issue.
<br>
<br>
Navigation
<br>
<br>
    Along with the Sort & Filter options, the icons at the top provided confusion to newer users. After a bit of fumbling around they got the hang of things, but to decrease the learning curve, options were moved below the avatar with text descriptions. This increased usability and decreased confusion.</p>
    
<h1> Conclusion </h1>

<p>Truvay scrapped away a lot of noise and aimed to provide the most valuable information during the trip planning process. After multiple iterations and conversations with many potential users, it became clear that a simple UI and a way to see their friends honest opinions was valuable. Every potential user said they would frequent a website like this with an NPS score of 9, it was clear that developing this application can provide simplicity in an industry that is synonimous  with complexity. However, with the aim of a simple UI, the biggest obstacle left to answer for the Truvay team is how will an application like this be monetized?</p>
