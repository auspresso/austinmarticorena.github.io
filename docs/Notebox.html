<h1> Overview </h1>
<p>Finding inspiration amongst the internet is an activity almost as popular as Googling something. While finding inspiration is the easy part, saving the source and finding where you actually saved it to can becoming a tedious task. Notebox aims to fix this issue. 
</p>

<h1> Problem </h1>
<p>There are hundreds of note taking apps but there is no one service known for link and photo saving. The additional problem is that many people don’t use note taking apps for these things and instead use their browser. Browsers don’t sync up uniformly across devices and are extremely difficult to organize in an efficient way. Notebox is a browser-based application that makes it easy to save these resources in an extremely visual and dynamic way.</p>
    
<h1> Solution </h1>
<p>Notebox is an in-browser application with a simple UI to save basic notes, photos and links. Because the service isn’t browser-dependent, it allows for you to view your sources from any device and any browser.</p>
    
<h1> Process </h1>
<p>It doesn’t matter who you are, if you use the internet, you are likely to come across any number of things that you find interesting, inspiring and worth saving. With so many tools out there, one might not realize the pitfall of trying to save these resources. However, after talking with other internet browsing individuals, the following was discovered: </p>
    
<h2> Survey Feedback </h2>
<ul>
<li>86% of respondents save interesting content on a regular basis.</li>
<br>
<li>Almost 60% of respondents use browsers to save this content</li>
<br>
<li>Most cited issues, in order, include organization of content and device limitations</li>
<br>
<li>85% take notes to remember things for a later time</li>
<br>
<li>The same issues were cited including organizing notes and finding them when they are needed</li>
</ul> 
</p>
    
<h2> Personas </h2>
<p>After looking through the survey results, it was clear that there is a clear opportunity to provide real value while saving content from web browsing. To keep the on track with their goals, frustrations and needs, three personas were developed to guide the design process.</p>
    
<h2> Competitive Analysis </h2>
<p>The main competition for Notebox, outside of browsers, included Ember, Apple Notes, and Evernote. I took a look at the competition through the use of competitive and SWOT analysis’ which can be found here.</p>
    
<h2> User Flows</h2>
<p>User Flows were developed to start getting a sense of how users would filter through a lot of data, with minimum effort on their end. You can find a detailed look at the flows here</p>
    
<h2> User Stories </h2>
<p>The core user stories include:
<br>
<br>   
Users should be able to view their content
<br>
<br>
Users should be able to add and view their favorite content
<br>
<br>
Users should be able to add content (notes, images, links)
<br>
<br>
Users should be able to add collaborators
<br>
<br>
Users should be able to share their content with others
</p>
    
<h2> Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
<p> Using the basic user stories above, I create the intial wireframes to start to understand how the application should flow. </p>
    
<h2> Creating the Identity </h2>
<p>
The color palette was chosen to be a bit more muted than most applications in this space but colorful enough to be engaging. The goal was to provided a simple UI with minimal features to provide a tool an average internet user would be able to fully utilize.
<br>
<br>
The logotype is a simple notepad that was designed to look good at a large and small scale and reflects the goal of the application as well as the product name. </p>
    
<h2> High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
<p> At this point, I had enough validation and resources to start building out the designs of the application. Using Sketch, I built each iteration of the application. </p>
    
<h2> User Testing Feedback</h2>
<p>
Testing throughout the process, a few adjustments needed to be made:
<br>
<br>
Add button
<br>
<br>
Moved the add button near the left side navigation. Potential users found this easier to create content
<br>
<br>
Avatar
<br>
<br>
Avatar was initially at the bottom left section of the dashboard. Most users liked the idea of added content at the top of the screen as well as account management with the left side of the screen for actually view and managing existing content
</p>
    
<h1> Conclusion </h1>

<p>Notebox is a simple tool that can help any individual with a basic understanding of computers keep track of their content and creates one central place to keep track of these sources that isn’t dependent on any one browser and device. It is also more visual and easier to organize content than most tools available in this space. The internet is truly a pandora box of content that can easily be lost. With Notebox, that doesn’t have to be the case.</p>
