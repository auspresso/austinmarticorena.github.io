<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p>Solutionreach’s goal for the past 18 years has been to help disrupt the way healthcare practices communicate with their patients. That goal began in 2000 with the creation of appointment reminders via text and email. Since then, it has streamlined ways to schedule appointments online, created apps to text their patients, as well as provide tools to manage online reviews.
</p>

<p>In 2018, it was realized there wasn’t just inefficiencies with the way that practices communicate with their patients, but also within their own offices. I was part a project to diagnose the major problems within practice communication and if there was a solution we could build to solve those problems. SR Huddle was the result of this project.
</p>

<h1> The Challenge </h1>
<p>The issue of internal communication was noticed through in-app feedback, customer visits, customer calls and observations in Sales and Client Success. Broadly speaking, practices voiced they were looking for a simple app to communicate within their practices. Sounds simple enough, right? The only issue is that medical verticals treat their workflows very differently and even those in the same vertical use different Practice Management Software and vary dramatically in size. Early on, we decided on the following goals to help formulate a solution:
</p>

<ol>
<li> Understand how practices are currently communicating and how this has and hasn't worked in the past.</li>
<br>
<li> Understand any tools or processes for communicating they were currently evaluating as well as have used in the past.</li>
<br>
<li> Discover if there were enough trends to inform an application that could be applied to multiple verticles, office sizes and needs.</li>
</ol>
	
<h1> The Problem </h1>
<p>As practices grow, they find themselves with challenges the previously didn’t know existed. This can range from issues around billing, coordinating care, managing communications with patients and ensuring accurate communications occur with various staff throughout a patient’s experience throughout their visit. However, with growth comes the very real problem, and cost, of trying to find the right solution to your problems and train everyone on new processes. Practice’s knew they needed a better solution to communicate but whatever tool they chose needed to be simple yet robust to handle the needs of their practice while staying HIPAA compliant. </p>

<h1> My Role </h1>
<p> My role included the following:

<ul>
<li><b>Customer Insights + Ideation</b> I worked closely with a product manager and gathered a lot of support from both our group product manager and our design team lead to uncover insights and transcribe those into features that address both problems and motivations.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Experience Strategy + Vision</b> I led many whiteboard sessions and built prototypes to help build the vision and gain buy in from key stakeholders within the company on what an MVP could look like and what the long term vision for the product roadmap could look like 6-12 months out.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Design Execution + Validation</b> I was in charge of building out wireframes and prototypes to ensure we built the right product and turn out design specs of the validated features.</li>
</ul> 
</p>
    
<h2> Personas </h2>
    
<h2 class="npersonas"></h2> 
    
<p>After looking through the survey results, it was clear that there is a clear opportunity to provide real value while saving content from web browsing. To keep the on track with their goals, frustrations and needs, three personas were developed to guide the design process.</p>
    
<h2> Competitive Analysis </h2>
<p>The main competition for Notebox, outside of browsers, included Ember, Apple Notes, and Evernote. I took a look at the competition through the use of competitive and SWOT analysis’ which can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JiZhC8g012IIHYDQSiouC-sK9T3Nsqc-Z2R5DgyzOTU/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a></p>
    
<h2> User Flows</h2>
    
<h2 class="nflow"></h2> 
    
<p>User Flows were developed to start getting a sense of how users would filter through a lot of data, with minimum effort on their end. You can find a detailed look at the flows <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5I2M2EpIsFISXp3aTFLVkdXN1k/view?usp=sharing">here.</a></p>
    
<h2> User Stories </h2>
<p>The core user stories include:
<br>
<br>   
Users should be able to view their content
<br>
<br>
Users should be able to add and view their favorite content
<br>
<br>
Users should be able to add content (notes, images, links)
<br>
<br>
Users should be able to add collaborators
<br>
<br>
Users should be able to share their content with others
</p>
    
<h2> Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>

<p> Using the basic user stories above, I create the intial wireframes to start to understand how the application should flow. </p>
    
<h3 class="nlow"></h3>
    
<h2> Creating the Identity </h2>
    
 <p>The logotype is a simple notepad that was designed to look good at a large and small scale and reflects the goal of the application as well as the product name. </p>
    
<h3 class="nuno"></h3>

    
<p>
The color palette was chosen to be a bit more muted than most applications in this space but colorful enough to be engaging. The goal was to provided a simple UI with minimal features to provide a tool an average internet user would be able to fully utilize. I wanted a bright yet simple color palette and was torn between the two palettes below. I ultimately went with the second row as I thougt the mint and dark navy colors were just slightly more appealing for the brand image I hoped to achieve.
</p>

<h3 class="ntype"></h3>
    
<h2> High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
<p> At this point, I had enough validation and resources to start building out the designs of the application. Using Sketch, I built each iteration of the application. </p>
    
<h3 class="nhigh"></h3>
    
<h2> User Testing Feedback</h2>
<p>
Testing throughout the process, a few adjustments needed to be made:
</p>

<p>
<u>Add button</u>: Moved the add button near the left side navigation. Potential users found this easier to create content.
</p>
    
<p>
<u>Avatar</u>: The avatar was initially at the bottom left section of the dashboard. Most users liked the idea of added content at the top of the screen as well as account management with the left side of the screen for actually view and managing existing content.
</p>
    
<h3 class="ndash"></h3>
    
<p>
<u>Color</u>: After getting some feedback that the platform looks a little bare bones, I focused on adding enough color to make the brand seem more realiable, yet still keep the platform as simple as possible.
</p>
    
<h3 class="npal"></h3>
    
<h1> Conclusion </h1>

<p>Notebox is a simple tool that can help any individual with a basic understanding of computers keep track of their content and creates one central place to keep track of these sources that isn’t dependent on any one browser and device. It is also more visual and easier to organize content than most tools available in this space. The internet is truly a pandora box of content that can easily be lost. With Notebox, that doesn’t have to be the case.</p>
